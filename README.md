# VertoTest
Verto Website Test - As part of a job application

I am new to Github.
I realize that in uploading the Packages sub-Directory to the same level as the VertoTest directory is not right. I tried to
upload the Packages directory, but was constrained by the 25Mb limit. I could not immediately find a way to correct this error.

Hopefully, I will be able to learn a better way of doing this in the future.
